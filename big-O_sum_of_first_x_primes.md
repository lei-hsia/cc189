The work performed by this algorithm is almost entirely the operations to cull the composite number representations which for the basic non-optimized version is the sum of the range divided by each of the primes up to that range or

n * SIGMA(p<=n) (1/p); 

Merten's 2nd theorem: this equals n(log logn + M) as n approaches infinity, M is the Meissel-Mertens constant, about 0.261 497

#####sum of first x primes: 
(1/2)* (x^2)*log(x)

big-O of sieve of Eratosthenes: O(N(log logN))
