#####Q: time complexity of Fib(n):

```
int fib(int n){
	if(n<=0) return 0;
	else if(n==1) return 1;
	return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
}
```
1. rough: recursive calls: O(branches^depth): there'are 2 branches per call, go as deep as N, therefore the runtime is O(2^n).

2. but the more accurate one:O(1.6^n)

3. prove: 

time function to calculate fib(n) = time to calculate fib(n-1) + time to calculate fib(n-2) + addition of these two O(1), i.e. <br>

T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1)

Assume T(n)=a^n (a>1). 

a^n = a^(n-1) + a^(n-2)

Divide by a^(n-2): a^2=a+1, => a=(1+sqrt(5))/2 = 1.61803(the golden ratio, this is how Fib is related to Golden ratio)

so time complexity is exponential, O(1.6^n)
